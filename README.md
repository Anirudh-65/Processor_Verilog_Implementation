# Custom Processor Design – Vivado Based Project

This repository documents the complete design and simulation workflow of a custom-built processor using Verilog HDL on the Xilinx Vivado platform. The processor was designed from scratch with modular components and thoroughly tested through simulation and synthesis.

## Project Summary

The goal of this project was to conceptualize, implement, and simulate a basic processor architecture capable of executing arithmetic, logical, memory, and control instructions. This processor forms a minimal computing system that demonstrates instruction-level operation and basic datapath control.

The project was developed using a structural design methodology in Verilog and tested comprehensively using Vivado’s built-in simulator.

## Repository Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- The `Design_Sources/` folder contains all the Verilog modules used to build the processor. These include the ALU, Register File, Control Unit, Program Counter, and the top-level module.
- The `Simulation_Sources/` folder consists of testbenches, input memory files, and waveform simulation setups used to test the complete processor system.
- Two markdown documents, `Processor Explanation.md` and `Results and Observations.md`, provide a detailed explanation of the system architecture and simulation outcomes, respectively, along with relevant visual screenshots.
